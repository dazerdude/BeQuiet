# BeQuiet
A simple add-on that suppresses the giant frame and the audio for the talking chat heads from NPCs when entering world quests or instances only leaving their text in the regular chat box.

Use '/bq' to see the help and available options.

You can enable or disable the add-on functionality on the fly and you can also toggle the blocking functionality specifically for Ashran, Island Expeditions, and Nazjatar.
