# BeQuiet
Simple, non-configurable add-on that suppresses the giant frame and the audio for the talking chat heads from NPCs when entering world quests or instances only leaving their text in the regular chat box.

This add-on was adapted from https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/hidetalkinghead but was modified to include code comments and to disable the audio as well.

I recommend this add-on after experiencing the content at least once from the various instances and class hall quests.

Once you begin to reach the end-game this will likely be the add-on for you.

v1.6.1 Blocks talking heads on island expeditions again due to feedback from users. Thanks!
